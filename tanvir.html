            <blockquote>It was in the morning when I first saw you and you were getting out of the bed. On the first sight I thought how I was going to be a friend with you. After that I went to take bath. I saw many of them were waiting to take bath. After you I was next to go in. The flow of water from the pipe was slow, so you helped me by fetching the water into the bucket while you were taking bath. When I went in, I saw that the color of the water inside my bucket was yellow. I thought you would have pissed in it. So I didn't use that bucket. Because I don't believe people so easily. As days passed by I believe you more than anyone.

            <blockquote>I find something different whenever I am with you. Whenever I am in a difficult situation, I think about what Tanvir would do when he get this situation. You explored my world more than I did. You nudged my limits. You gave me many unforgetable moments. My problems become ligher after I share with you. Before we know each other I was shy to speak with people. I was thinking bad about me. You changed that.
