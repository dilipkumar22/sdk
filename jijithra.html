            <blockquote>I know you since from our class 8th. We were sharing 8th rank and once without unknowingly I showed up when your name was called. Those days in our class 8th will be remebered untill I die. I thought you would be my girl bestie forever. But those
thoughts shattered when I heard those and taken into account. I was wrong to believe that. But now I am clear about the relationship between us. You are my bestie.
