                 A person who never turns old, never hastes and rarely an imbecile...sometimes! I know you from our class 7th....I guess. On my first sight on you, I saw you 
		as a leader of a specific group. Apparently, the duo groups didn't last too long. It was a great moment to be with you and sometimes I tried not to 
		type this but i have to "I was so envious on the way of your Juvenileness". However, I tried and aquired that quality of being juvenile.
                My wish to visit the High court made possible because of you. The non-fictional story which you said to me on the banks of Bessan Nagar beach was like
 		having a beverage that I hadn't before. Cheers!
