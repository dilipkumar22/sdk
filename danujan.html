            <blockquote>I know you since I was 13. On the first sight I came to know that you were a foreigner. That rosy lips stunned everyone. Some kind of craziness speculated to be a friend with you. I was surrounded by a bunch of bad people. Our friendship drove me out of it. Things changed and sometimes we disputed for nothing. But those were our history.

            <h2><u>Moments you gave me</u></h2>
            <blockquote>I find something different whenever I am with you. You created a strong confidence in me. You explored my world more than I did. You nudged my limits. You gave me many unforgetable moments. My problems become lighter when I share with you. You taught me how to bowl. My studies got improved only because of you. It was fuckin moment when we did a ppt together. I could say that I would be nothing if I didn't meet you.
