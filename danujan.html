           I know you since we were 13. I remember.....everyone whispered that u were a foreigner on the first day of class 8th. That rosy
           lips stunned everyone. Haha! Some kind of craziness speculated to be a friend with you. I was surrounded by a bunch of bad people
           and our friendship drove me out. Things went bad and sometimes we disputed for nothing. It wouldn't have happened if i kept quiet.
           I felt different whenever I am with you. You built me, you explored me and you pushed my limits. You gave me many everything but i didn't
           gave anything in return. I always wanted to stick with u. You taught me how to bowl and I remember I got the best bowler award and that was becoz
           of u. My studies got improved because of you. I also wanted to admit, it was a fuckin moment when we did a ppt together. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!.
           My wish for u is....be with me.

            I was planned to do UG with u. But I got some kind of thought that triggered me to leave u. 
            It was not the reason i said to u. It was about myself who thought of leaving u to show I was strong even without u....I know
            I was wrong....I just wanted you to know about it. I am sorry. Sometimes I hate myself for this.
