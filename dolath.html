           I teased you as much as I can becoz I loved to do that. I remember we were fucked on listening to Alex 
           explanation of a movie. Roughly, he took an hour to describe and after that we were chased by the dogs. Lot of things happened
           on that single day. The way you slept in the exam hall, often put a smile on my face. You were with me in my hard times and gave hope
           when no one was willing to stay with me. You concerned me more than I did on myself.
           More than a friend you are a brother to me.
