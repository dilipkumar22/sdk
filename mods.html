 I know you since 2015. We were on the same boat but as things became deteriorate, I decided to board another. I saw your disguise part
 when you talk with me. Your words on me often hurted. You played with my weakness. You once said that I won't be looking good unless I am 
 within a group. But these things faded when I started to understand you. I listed your good and bad deeds on me. The good deeds are more
 than the bad ones. That showed the human nature. But still I don't want these kind of thoughts to bother me. So I left you. You made a call
 to ur astrologist aunt and made everyone to speak except me..Wht did u do that??...I wanted to ask but suddenly I decided why the fuck
		    should i care.
