                 Actually I have to admit for the day when i turned mad for waiting to see the new comer to our class. I was mad enough to do that. I never talked or
            shook my hand to my contrary gender. I got urs on my 17 birthday and on that day I decided to overcome my nature. Apparently, on that day I felt almost dizzy
            when u raised ur hand for a handshake. Now I am 21 and I have improved a lot to have a clear talk with a girl and as a cite I had done more. The thing is
            I shattered my shyness and that is because of u. I m happy to have u buddy.
