                The unevitable training made me a jerk and I don't know what it was meant for, perhaps more than that, it gave me 
a friend. It felt like I got someone for myself. One thing I got inspired from you is the quality of being happy for others.
My beloved one walked out of my life for a silly reason. I was perplexed and finallay i decided not to have someone because on one day they
would be a slump in my life but these things on my little brain dropped out by a spark and that spark is caused by you. We got some qualities
in common. Never do the same as the erstwhile did to me.
