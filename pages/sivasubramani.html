            The unevitable training made me a jerk and I don't know what it was meant for, perhaps more than that, it gave
            me
            a friend. It felt like I got someone for myself. One thing I got inspired from you is the quality of being
            happy
            for others.
            My beloved one walked out of my life for a silly reason. I was perplexed and finallay i decided not to have
            someone
            because on one day they
            would be a slump in my life but these things on my little brain dropped out by a spark and that spark is caused
            by
            you. We got some qualities
            in common. Never do the same as the erstwhile did to me.
