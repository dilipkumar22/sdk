            <blockquote class="text-justify">I know you from our class 3. Apparently, on the first sight I came to know that you were rude to people.
            Later I found it was not what I thought about u. I remember..we were playing "Running and Catching" game till 5th std.
            We did a play in our class 9th, whole heartedly it was great to act as your son. It was about 8 years ago. I was hesitated to
            talk with whity people but you shattered that thought. I liked to call you as my sis because you cared me a lot especially when I was 
            confused and baffled while choosing my career. 
            Sudden care came out when you said that you would be more happier if you were a boy. After that I started treating you like a boy.
            My problems became lighter when I share with you. I saw the power of a girl
            when you spoke off to Thangabalu, actualy it was rude and a thud strike of words on him. I learned 
            many things from you. May be I am replaced in your life but still I have you in mine. I felt bad becoz you didn't say that ur hired.
            If I didn't ask about it, it would be remained unknown. But u said to some. why not me??........remain what u are and stay out.                 
            "Why did we grew old, things won't be 
            complicated if that dind't happen". :( :(
