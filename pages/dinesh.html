               	A person who believed me and shared his problems with me....that every man says to their beloved ones. I know you from the starting day of our college and
           I guess it was a great start. I remember...we got ourselves in trouble on the first day for laughing for the name BURMA ALVIN, still it puts a smile on my
           face. Everytime I spend with you, gives a great sensation. Sometimes I felt of not concerning you when you need me...I am really sorry for that. Its like we
           are going to say goodbye to each other but still i will keep in touch with you.
