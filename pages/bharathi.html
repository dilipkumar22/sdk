                 I loved your juvenile character..actually I still love that. I remember that the way you kicked the ball on the refree's face and that put a smile on everyone's
            face....Haha!. I bet he would still remeber you for that. We got good days together and some that we need to forget. I know that you are under certain circumstances
            that you cant share with your own
            mates. I came to know that after you got up for the things that you have done to our mates. Seriouly, I would have done that if I was in ur position. I shouldn't
            have said this at the fire camp but I want you to know that people along with me will be always there for u when you are in need. I wish for your break
            through in this sulking life.
