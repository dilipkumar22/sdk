            <blockquote>I know you since 2015. We play football for the same team so I hope that made us to be hooked up so soon . I was so happy because you stood for me the most. Your room was next to mine in our first year of degree. We kept each other busy. When we moved to our next year, everything changed as compared to before. We disputed for many things. But I am sure that remains historic. I will be for you whenever you need me. I gonna miss you a lot.
