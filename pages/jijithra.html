           We were closer on our class 8th. We were sitting on the same bench and sharing pelicans were still having a vivid feel. We were 
           sharing the same rank and once unknowingly I showed up when your name was called. Everyone made me to cry for that. Those days
           are immortal. I thought you would be my best friend forever but those thoughts shattered when I heard you were having a crush on
           me and I was stupid enough to believe that. I admit, when I heard this i was half dead and I also wanted to make that...but i cant.
           But now I am clear about what is between us. You are my best friend. I remember...you asked me to make a fight with our seniors
           for teasing u. To be true, I was terrified when u said this to me. My heart was beating fast and i was not able to take my step.
           HAHA! It was a great moment. Illakia didn't say that she got her job
           but u did. You are good to me and I am sorry i never concerned on you.
