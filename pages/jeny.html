                	A person who insisted the value of groupism and often prevades the hope. I admired you and your accent mostly in our english classes. That 
created an envy..yes it happened. I remember...you stood beside me when I sobbed and that gave me an assurance of your presence that would never fade. In our class 10th
you stood for us against the funny pigs and I still remember someone saying "Jeny-The hero". You shared your privacy stuffs....you shouldn't have. I admit, you are quite
an inspiration to me. I miss those days with you and your tales with ur gfs. HAHA!....If I decide to write a book, that would be the story of you. I miss you doc. Come
back soon. I will be the most happiest person on earth to see you as a doc....cheers!
