             A person who burps, mimics about the faculties and sleeps during the history class. I was absolutely enjoyed your mimicking skills. On hearing the 
        problems which were about your father made me to be a close friend with you. We were on the same club house and I remember your mistake on the shot-put
        event made us down on the score board. HaHa! :P It doesn't matters anymore. I really miss you and your funny doing in our study hall. I still miss those days.
 	And I promise that I will fuck you when I see you. :)
