            <blockquote>It was in the morning when I first saw you and you were getting out of your bed. On the first sight I thought how I was gonna be a friend with you. On the first day I saw many of them were waiting to take bath. After you I was next to go in. The flow of water from the tap was too slow, so you fetched the water into my bucket while you were bathing. When I went in, I saw the water in my bucket was coloured yellow. I thought you would have pissed in it. So I didn't use that bucket as I don't trust people so easily. As days passed by I started believing you more than anyone.

            <blockquote> Whenever I am in a difficult situation, I think about what Tanvir would react in that situation. You explored my world more than I did. I find something different whenever I am with you. You nudged my limits. You gave me many unforgetable moments. My problems become ligher after I share with you. Before we know each other I was shy to speak with people. I was thinking bad about me. Things changed as days passed by and that was only because of you.
