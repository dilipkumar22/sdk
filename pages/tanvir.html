           It was in the morning when I first saw you and you were getting out of your bed. On the first sight I thought how I was 
           gonna be a friend with you. On the first day I saw many of them were waiting out of the bathroom compartment to take bath. 
           After you I was next to go in. The flow of water from the tap was too slow, so you fetched the water into my bucket while you 
           were bathing. When I went in, I saw the water in my bucket was coloured yellow. I thought you would have pissed in it. 
           So I didn't use that bucket for years. This happened becoz I don't trust people so easily. As days passed by I believe
           you more than anyone. I almost became a replica of urs. Whenever I am in a difficult situation, I think of u and how would you 
           react in this situation. You explored my life more than I did. I find something different whenever I am with you. 
           You pushed my limits. You gave me many unforgetable moments. My problems become ligher when I share with you. 
           I was shy to speak with people. I was thinking bad of me. These thoughts were vanished and that was only because of you.
