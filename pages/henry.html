                    We were together for more than a decade. You are my first friend that I got in my life time. We never sticked together but I got a special place for you
             in my tiny heart. I remember I splashed the water on your face by making a hole on the water botttle and you did it to me as soon as possible. However it was our invention.
             Ms. Mythili and Mr Raja were our idols for a specific period of time.....I guess. I know I was bad about ur gf Keerthi. On that day I made u too feel bad and I admit
             I was wrong. Our hostel dorm happenings which are like- doing stomps, talking about sinister stories. Yeh..those were not going to fade in our lives.
             Company 1, Company 2....over over..HaHa!!... I wish u for a great fortune.
