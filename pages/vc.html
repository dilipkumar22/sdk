            <blockquote>I know you since 2015. I used to make fun on my friends. Likewise I did it on you. But who pulled my shirt infront of everyone that made me to hate you. This happened before 3 years. So I never turned onto you. Later that era was over and we sticked around each other. We started to kill our own fears by doing more ppts. No one shared their relationship with their woman but you did. I noticed the stubourness and persistence in you. You always wanted to be at the first place. But my advice to you is that make others to get there and I am sure you will be happy than that.

            <blockquote class="text-justify">
                We did more ppts. Among those I love the first one because that gave me a great moment than the others. We roamed around the city in Ooty to have a talk with a foreign lady. My wish on tasting the beer became real only because of you. Let our frienship be an eternity.
