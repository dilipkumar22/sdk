                I dont know how you are, what you are and more than that idk ur last name but still i want to ur friendship...thats crazy right?? but believe me its not.
I had spoken to u twice and the latter one was the best than the former. I felt like a kindergarden kid while singing "ba ba black sheep" and that evoked little dilip.
I thank u for that bcoz u made me to do that. Eventhough I couldnt understand a single word that u have laid out, I admit that u got a good tone when u sing.
I dont know what made u to think that i m rude nd cruel...I m really sry for that and I wont talk about that anymore. I swear I wont cross my line and 
I will have u as my cute chelli. I decided to have u as my chelli bcoz i dont have one. I know I made you to feel bad when I talked abt ur brother and thats bcoz I 
always wanted to be a hope for the one who needs it and I m sure thats in my blood. Idk whether to say this or not but still I wanted to say that next time when you
meet ur brother, give him a slap and say to him what u feel......will u?
