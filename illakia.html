            <h1><q><b>The Care Taker</b></q></h1>
            <blockquote>I know you since I was 7. On the first sight I came to know that you were rude.  Later you proved it was wrong. We did a play in our class 9th. Whole heartedly it was great. It was in the evening of the pongal festival in 2012 when I texted you for the first time. It was about 5 years to have a talk with you. I feared to talk with both fair man and woman. But you cleared that thought inside me.
            
            Sudden care came out when you said that you would be happy if you were a boy. After that I treated you as a boy. My problems became lighter when I share with you. You said about the problems faced by the woman. I saw the power of a girl when you spoke off to Thangabalu. That made me to share the secrets with you. My studies got improved because of you. Finally I could say that I would be nothing if I didn't meet you.
