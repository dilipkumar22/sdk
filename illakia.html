            <blockquote>I know you from my class 3. On the first sight I came to know that you were rude to people. Later I found I was wrong. We did a play in our class 9th. Whole heartedly it was great. In 2012 I texted you for the first time. It was about 5 years to have a talk with you. I got the fear of talking with fair man and woman. But I found I was wrong when I have you as my friend.
           I liked to call you as my sister because you cared me a lot when I was confused on choosing my career. 
            Sudden care came out when you said that you would be happy if you were a boy. After that I started treating you like a boy. My problems became lighter when I share with you. You said about the problems faced by a woman. I saw the power of a girl when you spoke off to Thangabalu. That was thud moment. My studies got improved because of you. I learned many things from you. Finally I could say that I would be nothing if I didn't meet you.
