            <blockquote>I know you from our class 3...I guess. Apparently, on the first sight I came to know that you were rude to people.
            Later I found it was not what I thought. I remember..we were playing "Running and Catching" game till 5th std.
            We did a play in our class 9th, whole heartedly it was great to act as your son. It was about 8 years. I got the hhesitation of
            talking with fair people. You shattered that thought. I liked to call you as my sister because you cared me a lot when I was 
            confused and baffled like choosing my career. 
            Sudden care came out when you said that you would be happy if you were a boy. After that I started treating you like a boy.
            My problems became lighter when I share with you. You said about the problems faced by a woman. I saw the power of a girl
            when you spoke off to Thangabalu, actualy it was rude and a thud strike on him. My studies got improved because of you. I learned 
            many things from you. May be I am replaced in your life but still I have to say this "Why did we grew old, things won't be 
            complicated if that dind't happen. :( :(
