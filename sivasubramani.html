                The unevitable training gave nothing to know and I don't know what it is meant for, perhaps it gave me a friend. It felt like, I got an advisor for my decision. I found a person who becomes happy for others in you.
People often say I'm too complicated to understand. When I stepped into my final year, I decided not to love people and things because at one moment it creates a slump in me, but these things on my mind faded when I started coping with you. I learnt many things from you.
We got some qualities in same.
