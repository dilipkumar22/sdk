           We were room mates for the past two years. I love to tease u and I guess I do it more than anyone. As I said everyone is blessed
           with something and u r best in being fucked....I was kidding. You r best in your practical knowledge and to be true I admire it.
           I liked your perfection on your work.  One thing I hated in you is that you never shared your problems with anyone and you 
           hardly spent time with people. So as a result you are failing to make moments. When we moved to our final year, 
           I decided to leave everyone of our room mates including you. On my perspective I could see ur happiness whenever I fail. 
           LOL! Those things never bothered me but that boosted me a lot. Also I was in need to get new faces surrounded by me. 
           So I moved out.
