            <blockquote>I know you since 2016. We were room mates for the past two years. I teased you as much as I can since I loved to do that. I learn many things from you. I liked your intensiveness on your work .  One thing I hated in you is that you never shared your problems with anyone and you spent less time with people. So as a result you failed to give moments. When we moved to our final year, I decided to leave everyone of our room mates including you. Sometimes I saw the happiness in you when I failed at my work. LOL! Those things never bothered me but that boosted me a lot. Also I was in need to get new people surrounded by me. So I moved out.
